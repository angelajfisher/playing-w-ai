# Playing w/ AI

## Human Foreword

This is the home of some super quick vibe-coded projects used in an experiment in prompting some AI-assisted coding tools using various models.

If you're curious about what the AI made, you can check out the projects [on GitHub Pages](https://angelajfisher.github.io/playing-w-ai).

Now with that context out of the way, say hi to Claude ðŸ‘‹

### Deployment

#### Automatic Deployment

1. Push changes to the `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions will automatically copy all projects and deploy to GitHub Pages
3. Projects will be available at the URLs above

#### Manual Deployment

Run the deployment script locally:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

### Setup Instructions

Since projects are already built, simply:

1. Add your built React projects to `calculator/`, `tic-tac-toe/`, and `todo-list-manager/` directories
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings (source: "GitHub Actions")
3. Push to main branch - deployment happens automatically
